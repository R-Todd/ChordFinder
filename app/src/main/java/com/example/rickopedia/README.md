# Rickopedia

Rickopedia is an Android application that lets users search for characters from the Rick and Morty universe, view detailed information about any character, and save favorites locally. It follows the MVVM architecture and uses Jetpack components along with popular thirdâ€‘party libraries for a smooth, polished UX.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

* **Search**: Look up characters by name using the search bar or the keyboard's search action.
* **Character List**: Displays search results with thumbnail, name, and status badge.
* **Details Screen**: Tap any character to see full details (status, species, gender, origin, last seen).
* **Favorites**: Mark/unmark characters as favorites and view your favorites list.
* **Offline Storage**: Favorites are stored locally with Room.
* **Loading Placeholder**: Shimmer effect while images load.
* **Material UI**: Clean, modern design with cards, chips, and smooth slideâ€‘in animations.
